# Image Classification using K-means clustering with Contextual Classification and Relaxation Labeling

First install all the packages requirements for this app using the requirements.txt.
Run the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the libraries now and will take sometime.

Run the file class_GUI:
1. Click 'Open' to start the app.
2. Input the image
3. Enter the value of number of clusters (k)
4. Click on 'Show k-means output' to see the result of soft k-means
5. Click on 'Enter compatibilty matrix' and enter matrix elements separated by space (for elements in a row)
and separated by comma for different rows.
ex: 
[[2 3 4]
 [1 3 4]
 [4 5 6]]
is written as 2 3 4,1 3 4,4 5 6

6. Enter number of neighbours and iterations in the given boxes.
7. Click on 'OK' to start contectual classification.
8. Now the results of contectual classification and soft k means can be seen by using previous and next buttons.
9. Results can be compared by opening in new window using the button given in GUI.
